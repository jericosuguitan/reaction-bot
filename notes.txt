from bot.py, lines 1 and 2

# from dotenv import load_dotenv
# load_dotenv()

there is an issue with using dotenv AND python-dotenv at the same time. 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46870700/python-not-importing-dotenv-module/47557793
solution was to uninstall dotenv's dependency (might be unnecessary) and also comment out the from/import lines in bot.py.

buildpacks in heroku's settings include both discord.py and and discord.js. assuming that i only needed discord.py as I am writing in python and not js.

^ this link above directed me to understand that python does not interact with json files (unless I'm learning that wrong?), so the json files aren't necessary. i haven't tested that yet but i don't want to break anything. 

Necessary files:
- Procfile (case sensitive)
- .env
- requirements.txt
- runtime.txt
- .gitignore
- bot file


Things to improve on:
- make roles non-removable (by clicking on reaction emote)
- set fam role limit to 1
- welcome message in specific family chat (ct: each fam chat is locked by assigned role)
- `` do i need to have separate fam chats ``


from another link, but did not help me whatsoever, unsure why.

# # # OR, the same with increased verbosity
# # load_dotenv(verbose=True)

# # # OR, explicitly providing path to '.env'
# # from pathlib import Path  # Python 3.6+ only
# # env_path = Path('.') / '.env'
# # load_dotenv(dotenv_path=env_path)
